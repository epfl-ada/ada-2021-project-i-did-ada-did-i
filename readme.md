Get each speaker’s vocabulary (series of words). Assign an importance score to each word (e.g tf-idf)/look at it’s complexity (dictionary dataset) to dismiss non-useful words.
Get data on the speakers (wikidata) to classify them by job title (+ education level, area of interest etc). Create a specific vocabulary for each job title (look at correlation). Each category would have a set of words associated with it (potentially weighted) and words can be in multiple categories. Words that are specific to only one domain 
This would be useful by itself to identify the vocabulary specific to different domains.
Enables to classify new quotes into domains, could classify quotes that don’t have an author into their probable domain.

Maybe look at the evolution of the vocabulary of different domains by taking each year separately. Would need speaker data per year as well (can change profession, ie Trump from tv show host to politician)
